# open-health-inspection-address-fixer
A tool for manually setting addresses that the Open Health Inspection Scraper missed

This tool gets the restaurants from the Open Health Inspection API, and uses Google Map API to show and map. It allows the user to move a marker around and get the coordinates. Finally the coordinates from the Google Map and the data of restaurants are stored in MongoDB Database from Mongolabs.com
